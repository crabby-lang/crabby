# Welcome to Crabby's Syntaxes Example

Note: Most of these are just concepts! They may or may not changed later on.

Also, I highly recommend to download the **Crabby Extension for VSCode**!
Just search "Crabby" and find one that is from "Kazooki123" just to make sure.

## EXPERIMENTALS

Most of the Crabby code that is being shown are experiments, meaning they may not
function well or completely don't work because they aren't being properly implemented
into the AST & Parser of Crabby yet.

You can notice this with the "- EXPERIMENTAL" tag being present in each Crab files.
