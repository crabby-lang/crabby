# Welcome to Crabby's Syntaxes Example

Note: **Most of these are just concepts!** They may or may not changed later on.

Also, I highly recommend to download the **Crabby Extension for VSCode**!
Just search "Crabby" and find one that is from "ingStudios" just to make sure.

## EXPERIMENTALS

Most of the Crabby code that is being shown are `experiments`, meaning they may not
function well or completely don't work because they aren't being properly implemented
into the AST & Parser of Crabby yet.

You can notice this with the **"- EXPERIMENTAL"** tag being present in each `.crab` files.

## Sections

In here, you'll notice two directories such as `high/` & `low/`, these directories indicates what
examples of crabby is High-Level (high directory) and which ones Low-Level (low directory) usually
containing memory safety stuffs, unsafe blocks, `FFIs`, etc.
