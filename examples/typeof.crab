// Typeof in Crabby - EXPERIMENTAL
// The `typeof` keyword in Crabby acts as a TYPE OPERATOR to extract a STATIC TYPE from a variable's value (at compile time of course)

// Basically does:
type SomethingType = typeof existingVar

// You can also do
let x = "this is a type"
let y: typeof x

// Crabby typeof objects

let person = { name: 'John', age: 67 }

type PersonType = typeof person // <- { name: String, age: Int}

// Got any problem? You can create an issue for this file!
