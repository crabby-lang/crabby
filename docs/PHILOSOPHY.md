# The Philosophy of Crabby

Crabby is designed to be a **multi-paradigm, high-level** programming language that emphasizes
<u>simplicity</u> while providing the power needed for professionals. With influences from **Python,
Rust, Go, Perl, Java, Ruby,** and functional programming, Crabby is crafted to provide developers
with an intuitive experience while offering <u>deep control</u> when needed.

Its design is driven by the principle of being easy to pick up but capable of scaling to more
complex tasks. Crabby offers a friendly syntax while also exposing powerful low-level features when
the developer needs more control.

## Simplicity in Syntax

Crabby embraces Pythonic simplicity. It is designed to have a minimal syntax for maximum expressiveness. Aimed at developers who value productivity, readability, and ease of use, Crabby focuses on removing boilerplates and unnecessary complexity from code

- No semicolons
- Clear, intuitive block structure (similar to Python)
- Dynamic typing with easy-to-understand conventions

Crabby is easy to read and learn, making it a great choice for beginners or developers looking for a quick prototyping language!

## Flexibility and Multi-Paradigm Design

Though Crabby is **high-level**, it allows to write in various paradigms:

- Imperative (`loops`, `conditional statements`, `mutable state`)
- Functional (first-class `functions`, `lambdas`, `immutability`)
- Object-Oriented / OOP (`classes`, `inheritance`, `encapsulation`)

Crabby lets you choose the style that fits the problem best.
Whether you need a script to automate tasks or a complex system that interacts directly with
hardware, Crabby is **flexible** enough to handle both!

## Memory Safety w/ Control

Inspired by [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), Crabby includes features for memory safety but in
a more approachable way. While Crabby is designed to be high-level and safe by default, it also
provides mechanisms for manual memory management via **`unsafe`** code blocks.

- Automatic memory management (e.g. garbage management collection in other high-level languages)
- Memory safety features for safe concurrent programming.
- Control when you need it: Crabby lets you dive into **unsafe** code when you need that low-level power, but it's not forced upon you.

## Performance: From High-Level to Low-Level

Crabby was built with performance in mind. While it is a high-level language, Crabby's design allows
it to compile to **native machine code** or in **VM bytecode** (CVM), giving developers flexibility
between runtime speed and portability.

- Optimized for Speed:
  - Crabby can handle performance-sensitive tasks without sacrificing readability.

- Efficient Compilation:
  - Thanks to its integration with **LLVM**, Crabby can be compiled into a fast, low-level machine code or into a bytecode that runs on the CVM.

This combination of flexibility and performance makes Crabby suitable for a wide variety of applications, from web development to embedded systems.

## Developer-Centric Features

Crabby takes the consideration into the developer experience (DX), aiming to make programming **fun and efficient.**

- Clear error messages:
  - The interpreter (and sooner for the compiler) aims to provide helpful, actionable feedback for developers, making debugging more approachable.

- Rich standard library:
  - From basic utilities to more complex tools (e.g. regex, json parsing, fs), Crabby is ready to tackle a variety of tasks.

- Documentation-first:
  - Each feature is documented with **clarity**, ensuring that developers can understand both the <u>philosophical</u> and <u>technical</u> details behind Crabby's design.

## Evolution Through Community Contribution

The philosophy of Crabby is built on community-driven development. While Crabby's design begins
with a *clear vision*, it will evolve based on the needs and contributions of its users.

- Open Source:
  - Crabby is open source under the **GPL-3** license. Everyone is encourage to contribute.

- Contributions are Welcomed:
  - Whether it's bug fixes, performance optimizations, or new language features, Crabby thrives when the community **is involved**.

## Crabby's Unique Identity

Crabby's essence lies in its ability to adapt to the **programmer's need.** From easy-to-learn
syntax to powerful low-level controls for experienced developers, Crabby is not just another
language - it's a **versatile** tool designed with both simplicity and power in mind.

While many languages excel in one area - Crabby excels in both. It is simple by default but
becomes powerful when needed. Crabby's architecture ensures that you can stay productive without
compromising on performance or control.

## The Future of Crabby

As Crabby grows, we envision it being used across a wide variety of **domains**, including:

- Web Development
- Embedded Systems
- Game Engines
- Data Processing
- Machine Learning
- System Programming (thanks to its low-level capabilities)

Crabby's flexibility, power, and simplicity make it an ideal candidate for a wide array of
development environments.

## A Vision for the Crabby Community

At the heart of Crabby is its community. This is a language built by developers for developers, with
a focus on **inclusivity, clear communications, and collaborations.** Everyone, regardless of
their experience level, is encouraged to contribute to the evolution of Crabby, and together, we will
continue to build a language that embodies **simplicity, flexibility, and power.**

## Conclusion

**SIMPLICITY MEETS POWER.**

Crabby is made with a single goal in mind: to make programming easy, fun, and powerful. Its design
is intentional, with the goal of providing an intuitive, approachable syntax for beginners, while
also offering the flexibility and low-level control that professionals need.

Whether you're scripting quick automation, building a web app, or diving into system-level
programming, Crabby provides the tools you need to get the job done without unnecessary complexity.
