# Modules In Crabby

This markdown guides users on how imports and exports work, how visibility works (public vs private),
dependencies and more.

> [!WARNING]
> Still very early, conceptual, and experimental. Modules in Crabby will be implemented later on but for now this docs exist as a preview and **demo** for Crabby's import & export system, also note that changes will occur once major updates have been release, Thank you for your patience.
