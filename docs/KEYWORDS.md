# Crabby's Keyword

> [!WARNING]
> Due to **Crabby's** early development stage, we expect you to not take some (or most) of these keywords seriously, the **interpreter** is currently still broken, so that's why the creator of the language is findings ways to fix it, it can take years, which is normal for a language that only has one person doing all the work. Thank you for your patience.

This markdown file will guide and inform you the available keywords of Crabby.

> [!TIP]
> In Crabby, keywords are categorized as **simple**, **reserved**, and **experimental**

## print()

In Crabby, you print by just typing:

```py
print("Hello World")
```

That's all it, no bloat, no unreadable bs, just... `print()`

## def

To create a function, use the `def` keyword.

```py
def doSomething() {
    print("I did something!")
}
```

**Note**: We are adding the `fun` keyword but currently it's a very experimental thing so no worries.

## pub

To make a function, structure, enum or a data public, use the `pub` keyword.

```rs
pub def publicFunction() {
    print("This is a public function.")
}
```
