## Introduction

![Logo](https://github.com/Kazooki123/crabby/blob/main/crabbylogo.jpg)

Crabby is a **Modern High-level**, **Versatile**, **Multi-paradigm**, **general-purpose**, and a **hybrid approach** programming language.
It is designed to be *readable*, *ease-to-use* for beginners, and *powerful* enough for advanced users.

Crabby is leaning into *multi-paradigm*, supporting paradigms like **OOP** and **Procedural** style of programming.
But if you want the functional nature of Crabby, It is still a **Functional** programming language by default.

It syntactically resembles **Python**, But it's a Functional programming language by default.

## What Change?

As you may notice, Crabby has been through phases of rewrite, and if you're thinking that
**Crabby** is abounded, well... You're Wrong!

Crabby has been officially and well be written in **Rust** due to it's memory safety and type checking compared to *C*.

Here's what changed:

1. It has Pythonic-style of Syntax BUT with a functional approach
2. It's purely functional (not yet for now)
3. JIT compile time
4. Runtime & Type checking on the work.
5. Error handling on the work
6. More parsing and features!

## Installation

`Note`: **We highly recommend to use the nightly toolchain edition of rust**

Step 1: Git clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kazooki123/crabby.git
```

Step 2: Make sure to have `rust` and `cargo` installed

```bash
cargo --version
```

Step 3: Build it and Test it for yourself

```bash
cargo build
cargo run examples/example.crab
```

## Syntax

In **Crabbyü¶Ä**, its' syntax mostly resembles **Python** in general BUT there are `hints` of Functional Programming syntax since Crabby aims to be versatile, functional and powerful to use not just for advanced programmers but for beginners also!

It's default file format is a `.crab` or `.cb`
But for now it's `.crab`

example.crab:

```js
let x = 42
let y = 314
var z = 10 // You can use the 'var' keyword too!
let message = "Hello, Crabby!"

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
print(message)
```

functions.crab:

```rs
pub def foo() {
    print("Hello!")
}

foo()
```

helloworld.crab:

```js
print("Hello, World!")
```

math.crab:

```js
// addition
let x1 = 1
let y1 = 2

// multiplication
let x2 = 4
let y2 = 7

// subtraction
let x3 = 10
let y3 = 3

// division
let x4 = 10
let y4 = 3

print(x1 + y1)
print(x2 * y2)
print(x3 - y3)
print(x4 / y4)
```

ifelse.crab:

```js
// if-else statements

let x = true
let y = false

if x {
    print("True!")
} else {
    print("Nope!")
}

```

loops.crab:

```py
let x = range(10)

for i in x {
    print(i) // Prints it 10 times
}

let y = 10

for i in range(y) {
    print(i)
}
```

Note: **Crabby** supports commenting, use `//` to comment out a code or leave a silly ahh message :3

Speaking of comments, **Crabby** also support `Docstrings`!

## Package Managerüì¶

The closest package manager `Crabby` can have is [crab](https://github.com/crabby-lang/crab/)ü¶Ä (which is still in development),
it functions likely the same as Rust `cargo` but for **Crabby**
