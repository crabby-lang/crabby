# CRABC: The compiler of Crabby

**Crabc** is a compiler for the [Crabby](https://github.com/crabby-lang/crabby.git) programming
language but instead of using the default interpreter, **crabc** compiles a `.crab` file into a
bytecodes or machine codes that the VM (Crab Virtual Machine) reads and outputs the result no matter
what system you're using. It's fast, great for projects and secure.

`⚠️ NOTE:` Crabc is very new, updates will occur over time and the concepts of the projects changes too.
