# Crabby Code of Conduct ⚖️

## Purpose

Crabby is an open source programming language project that aims to be simple on the surface, powerful when needed, and welcoming to everyone. This Code of Conduct exists to ensure that our community is respectful, inclusive, and focused on collaboration and learning.

We want Crabby to be a place where people of all skill levels, backgrounds, identities, and experiences feel safe contributing, asking questions, and sharing ideas.


## Our Values

The Crabby community values:

1. Respect for others, regardless of experience, identity, or background

2. Curiosity and learning over ego and gatekeeping

3. Constructive feedback instead of personal attacks

4. Collaboration over competition

5. Patience with beginners and those learning


## Expected Behavior

All contributors, maintainers, and community members are expected to:

- Be respectful and considerate in all interactions

- Use welcoming and inclusive language

- Assume good intentions when communicating

- Give constructive and actionable feedback

- Be patient with questions, mistakes, and differing opinions

- Respect differing levels of knowledge and experience


## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated in the Crabby community:

- Harassment, discrimination, or exclusion of any kind

- Personal attacks, insults, or demeaning comments

- Gatekeeping or shaming others for their skill level, tools, or background

- Hostile or aggressive communication

- Trolling, baiting, or intentionally derailing discussions

- Doxxing, leaking or any sort of hacking towards contributors

Any behavior that creates an unsafe or unwelcoming environment


This applies to all project spaces, including but not limited to:

- GitHub issues and pull requests

- Discussions and comments

- Documentation contributions

- Community chat platforms (if applicable)


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all Crabby-related spaces, both online and offline, where the project is represented. This includes interactions between contributors, maintainers, users, and observers.


## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct.

If unacceptable behavior is reported or observed, maintainers may take appropriate action, including but not limited to:

- Requesting a change in behavior

- Removing content that violates this Code of Conduct

- Temporarily or permanently restricting participation


Actions taken will be proportional to the severity and context of the behavior.


## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to the project maintainers through appropriate private channels (such as direct messages or email, if provided).

All reports will be reviewed with care, respect, and confidentiality.


## Community Philosophy

Crabby is designed with the belief that:

- Simplicity should not exclude power

- Advanced features should be optional, not mandatory

- Learning should be encouraged, not punished

**Everyone starts somewhere**


You do not need to be an expert to belong here.


## Acknowledgment

By participating in the Crabby project, you agree to uphold this Code of Conduct and help maintain a respectful and welcoming community for everyone.



This Code of Conduct may evolve as the project grows and the community expands.
